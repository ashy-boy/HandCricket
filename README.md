# Hand Cricket
A simple program to demonstrate hand cricket(a very popular game in my school).

# Instructions
You can enter runs or balls within the range 1 to 10.
The computer generates a random number between 1 to 10(both inclusive).

If you are batting -
You are out if computer number matches your input.

If your are balling -
Computer is out if computer number matches your input.

Try to score as many runs as you can and victory shall be yours!

# Best of Luck!
